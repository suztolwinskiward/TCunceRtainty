Description: This micro-package is really just a handful of utilities that work together to take a set of observed TC windspeed/central pressure/position observations (say, from HURDAT2 or ibtracs), and returns a vector of associated standard deviations for each observation.  The returned values are taken from the work of Ryan Torn and Chris Snyder in their 2012 Weather and Forecasting paper,"Uncertaintyof Tropical Cyclone Best-Track Information" (doi:10.1175/WAF-D-11-00085.1).
